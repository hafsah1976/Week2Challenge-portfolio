# Week-2Challenge-portfolio

## My Professional Portfolio

My motivation is to learn as much as I can from this course, in general. My aim is to learn new skills and apply them to solve real world problems. This project is built to showcase my new found skills to potential employers. This portfolio consists of a couple of projects that I have worked during the period of this course. I have included some class work activities in the work section to ensure the website has all inclusive functional links. I would add and replace the samples with actual projects as we move forward in the bootcamp. I have tried to apply everything we learned about CSS and HTML. This is a huge first step towards my career goals. Lots more to learn, all in due time.
